This is my first website project

Project's Name:
This is my assignment 1 project for the interactive development module. This project is about a website of wildlife park tourist attractions which features 3 different parks being the habitat of different groups of animals ranging from mammels to fishes and even reptiles. I also include special features such as what one can do at the wildlife parks and how they could plan their visit based on their choice of the wildlife parks after a brief introduction from the specific parks in the website. The main purpose to to allow viewers to have better knowledge about the different animals available in the parks and promote the wildlife reservse to encourage different groups of people to visit and enjoy their time there.

There are a total of 8 pages, consisting of a main page, 3 pages about the parks available, an activities page, a booking information page and finally a booking form for people to book their slots. The main page mainly highlights what the wildlife reserve has to offer and reasons why people should visit them. The 3 pages about the parks are to highlight what each park offer and allow people to make their decision on which park to go to or even all of them! The acitivities page is looking for those who like to have fun and attract people to visit for the wide range of activities available. There is also a map page which consists of all the park maps for anyone who wishes to have reference. The booking information along with the booking form is mainly for those who wish to visit and sign up.

Design Process:
The main theme of the website would be about a rainforest to enhance the viewing of the website to potential visitors.
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things. Each page will have a specific color theme. For example, the river safari would have an aquatic theme, mainly consisting colours from the different shades of green to blue. For the layout wise, I am trying to have a standardise consistent layout for different groups such as the parks would have the same layout to show consistency and not make it too messy for viewers to ensure easy absorption of information. I also made use of negative space to allow the things to stand out even more to make the webpage look better

The first step I took was through searching for some ideas on the suitable topic that I could do and I realised that I have many old photoes of different animals and decided to do an animal park website. I designed the basic wireframes first to have a guage on how my website would look like and ammend the wireframe if I have any sudden ideas that I would like to implement. Next, I designed the individual webpages using HTML and CSS for the layout. After getting the layout, implementing the remaining photoes would be easy as I would have the correct pixels to edit my photoes to suit the box. After finishing, I would add jasvascript features such as error checking and implementing a slideshow system for the showcasing of main things per webpage. Finally, I would give a check and any touch ups if needed.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to be able to understand the wildlife parks better as I am interested in animals and decide if this wildlife park has the things that I would want to see.
As a user, I would also want to have easy access to the various webpages and find out more what each park has to offer in detail before finalising my decision to visit the parks or not.
As a user type, I would also like to find out if the prices and timings are reasonable and worth it so that I can find time to visit the parks.
As a user type who wants to visit, I would like to know what are the different activities available so that I can have fun in the different wildlife parks.
As a user type, I would like to be attracted by the nice website which makes it even more interesting to read and therefore visit the park.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.



Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Home page: The main page where gives a brief introduction about what Griffin Wildlife (GW) is all about to attract visitors there.

3 Parks (River safari, zoological gardens and bird park): These 3 pages give a brief intro on what each park is about and the different activities offered in each of the individual parks.

Activities page: This page consists of every activity summarised in one page to allow viewers to identify the activities per park easily and decide which park they would like to visit.

Plan your visit page: This page gives the information about the opening hours of the park, the membership offers to attract people to buy them, and the ticket prices.

Booking form: This form is where people book their time slots and choice of park.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

Javascript
I used JS to implement features like captcha, slideshow animation and error checking for the forms. I did captcha as I feel that it would be of great use 

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
